# LTE-Sim-NU

Github for our group's work on LTE-Sim.  I suggest the following for work moving forward:  

- When making new changes always create a new branch.  Commit to the branch often and comment well so that others can follow what changes you are making.  
- Whenever you feel that your changes are ready to be merged with the main branch start a Pull Request.  Comment with the functionality changes being made.  Another member of our group should then review the changes befoe approving them to be merged into the main branch.
